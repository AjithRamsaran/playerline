Cooper Rush's success in Prescott's absence has nothing to do with the fact that Prescott won't play this weekend.

Watson made an early departure from the Packers' Week 5 loss to the Giants in London, the result of an injured right hamstring. He's already missed one game this season due to a hamstring issue (Week 3 at Tampa Bay), but it's unclear if he's in danger of sitting out Sunday against the Jets. Ultimately, Watson may have to get back on the field in some capacity Thursday and/or Friday to put himself in a position to play this weekend.","source":"CBS Sports","source_name":"cbssports","source_url":"http://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/players/news/all?utm_source=playerline.com&utm_medium=Playerline&utm_campaign=Playerline","source_logo":"https://www.playerline.org/test/static-endpoint/images/sources/square_logos/39px/cbssports.png","hash_url":"http://www.playerline.com/r/b0mB0Cm","type":"news","player_image_url":"https://www.playerline.org/test/static-endpoint/images/player_photos/31212.jpg"},{"id":"3349955","pid":"20435","time":"10/12/22","time_pst":"2022-10-12 12:34:21","pname":"Jonathan Williams","is_favorite":false,"position":"RB | WSH","title":"Commanders' Jonathan Williams: Won't play Thursday night","details":"Williams (knee) is listed as out for Thursday's game at Chicago, Zach Selby of the team's official site reports.

With Jonathan Taylor (ankle) sidelined, Lindsay was elevated from the practice squad for Week 5 and immediately saw an expanded role after Nyheim Hines (concussion) left the game following the Colts' first possession. It's unclear why Lindsay missed practice, but his absence is concerning given Taylor was held out of practice as well and Hines was limited to non-contact drills, leaving Deon Jackson and D'Vonte Price, who's on the team's practice squad, as the only healthy running backs participating Wednesday. More clarity on the Colts' backfield will come following Thursday and Friday's practices.","source":"CBS Sports","source_name":"cbssports","source_url":"http://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/players/news/all?utm_source=playerline.com&utm_medium=Playerline&utm_campaign=Playerline","source_logo":"https://www.playerline.org/test/static-endpoint/images/sources/square_logos/39px/cbssports.png","hash_url":"http://www.playerline.com/r/5bUV5gu","type":"news","player_image_url":"https://www.playerline.org/test/static-endpoint/images/player_photos/24357.jpg"},{"id":"3349937","pid":"30340","time":"10/12/22","time_pst":"2022-10-12 12:24:20","pname":"Dyami Brown","is_favorite":false,"position":"WR | WSH","title":"Commanders' Dyami Brown: Questionable for TNF","details":"Brown (groin) is listed as questionable for Thursday's game against the Bears.
